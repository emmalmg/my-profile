		<h1>Hello, I'm Emma üòä</h1>

		<h2>Who am I?</h2>
		<p> Hi, I am Emma. I am 18 yo and I live in Sceaux, near to Paris, with my parents and my sister. I am a student to EMLV, an international Business School. My friends often describe me as an extrovert girl. Let me introduce myself through my passions : </p>
		</div>
		<div class="card-white">
			<h2> Sports ü•ä</h2>
		<p> I have always been passionate about sports. My favorite sports are soccer, boxing and snowboard. I have been doing Tha√Ø boxing in a club since 4 years. I will also do English boxing at school.
		I did all types of sports:
		<ul>
			<li> Athletics, during 10 years </li>
			<li> Judo, during 7 years </li>
			<li> Football and horse riding, during 4 years </li>
			<li> Dance, during one year </li>
			<li> Ski, during 1√† years</li>
			<li> Snowboard, since 3 years</li>
		</ul> 
		</p>

		<h2> Animals and Nature üê∏</h2>
		<p> As far as I can remember, I have always been in love with animals. I firstly had red fishes, then I had gerbils and I have now guinea pigs. I especially like elephants and whales but it's pretty difficult to have that ones in a backyard! My goal in life is to have a country house with a cow, a horse and a goat, dogs and cats. I also like the nature, I am a little green around the edges and affected by global warning. So I try to do things to contribute as little as possible. I stopped my meat consomation and I don't eat anything that contains palm oil. </p>

		<h2> Other little hobbies üé§</h2>
		<p> I like to travel and discover new cultures. I have already visited Spain, Croatia, Italia, Corsica, and Crete. I dream of one day doing a roadtrip in Iceland with my friends or my family. I spend my days listening to music, singing and dancing on it (even if I'm not very good at it...). I also love French films with a bit of heavy, good-natured humour. If I had to give you an example, I would recite this:</p>
